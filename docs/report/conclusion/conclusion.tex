\section{Conclusion}
% Conclusion (evaluate design, team results, individual performance, learning experience)
We managed to implement a design that passes all mandatory requirements with two extra features: height-control and control via a mobile device.
It is unfortunate that we were not able to invest any more time in raw mode and wireless control due to the sheer amount of time it took to get the communication between PC and drone right.
However, as the current code base has proved itself being both robust and quick, it provides a solid basis to continue building upon.
Apart from communication we encountered fairly few big issues, the most notable we did encounter being integer under- and overflows and a conversion error due to careless mixing of signed and unsigned values.
Finally, the addition of a graphical user interface allowed for more sophisticated control and debugging of the design.
