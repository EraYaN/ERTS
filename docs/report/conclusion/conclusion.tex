{ \color{red} Specific items that must be included are a functional block diagram of the overall system architecture, the size of the C code, the control speed of the system (control frequency, the latencies of the various blocks within the control loop), and the individual contributions of each team member (no specification = no contribution). The report should be complete but should also be as minimal as possible. In any case, the report must not exceed 10 pages (A4, 11 point), including figures and appendices. Reports that exceed this limit are NOT taken into consideration (i.e., desk-rejected)!}
