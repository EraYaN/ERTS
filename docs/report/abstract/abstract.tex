%TODO[E]: Abstract
The goal is to implement a controller system and a ground-station-like application for use with a quadcopter.
The system should be fully stable and controllable from the ground-station.
The system has at least three stabilized axes, with an optional fourth one, that being height.\\
The resulting system has a cascaded P-controller for Roll and Pitch and a simple P-controller for the Yaw and Height axes.
The system is stable at \SI{100}{\hertz} control frequency.
A \SI{25}{\hertz} control input frequency plus negligible input lag makes the system very controllable.
